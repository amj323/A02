PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm
Download and Install WebStorm: You can download WebStorm from the official website: WebStorm Download
After installing, open WebStorm.
To integrate Git with WebStorm, navigate to File > Settings > Version Control > Git. Here, specify the path to the Git executable.
Once Git is integrated, you can now easily Clone a Repository by going to File > New > Project from Version Control > Git.
You can now Commit and Push changes directly from WebStorm.

PART 2: Glossary
Branch: A separate line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process.
Clone: A copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server or on the internet.
Commit An individual change to a file or set of files. It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID.
Fetch: Getting the latest changes from an online repository without merging them.
GIT: An open-source distributed version control system.
Github: A platform/service for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
Merge: Taking the changes from one branch and applying them onto another.
Merge Conflict: Occurs when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one file is modified and another is deleted.
Push: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
Pull: Refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll pull in those changes to your local copy so it's up to date.
Remote: This is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub. It can be connected to local clones so changes can be synced.
Repository: A directory or storage space where your projects can live. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host.
